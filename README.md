# MIS-451
This project focuses on improving the effectiveness of direct marketing campaigns conducted by a Portuguese retail bank. The bank regularly contacts customers by phone to promote a term deposit product. These efforts are costly, time consuming and often inefficient because many contacted clients are not likely to subscribe.
